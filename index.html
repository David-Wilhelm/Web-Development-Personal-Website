<!--
NOTE: Remember the 4 types of blocks!
      Block: Spans the entirety of the width of the website unless styled otherwise
      Inline: Takes up as much space as it needs. Using multiple inline elements will make them be placed side by side. Can't change width.
      Inline-Block: Best of both worlds
      None: Disappears from the websit but still keeps its room like an inline block.

NOTE: 4 Types of positions!
      Static: All html elements are static by default. Go by the default html rules.
      Relative: Position it relative to how it would have been if it was static. EX. Setting something Left: 20px;
      Absolute: Adding a margin to the "parent" element
      Float: Meant for wrapping text around an object. DON'T USE IT AS A FREE FOR ALL LAYOUT PROPERTY!!!

          <h3>SQL!</h3>
          <p>SQL became my favorite language very quickly during my Database Concepts course in college. Once finished, I even decided to help tutor the class to other students. With my first job out of college, I code in SQL and utilize everything data analysis related. From MySQL to SSIS to Tableau and more!</p>

          <h3>Finance</h3>
          <p>Learning how to handle my finances since I got my first job at 16 has caused me to grow a fassion for analyzing how to optimize it for myself and others! I enjoy being able to handle budgeting, working on finance spreadsheets and more.</p>
